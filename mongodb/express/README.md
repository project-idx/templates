# MongoDB

This is a basic Node.js application that connects to MongoDB and uses Express.js to create a simple API.

## Getting Started

The server should run automatically on port `3000` when starting a workspace. To run it manually, execute:

```
node server.js
```

1. Use the MongoDB extension from the left-hand sidebar to connect to the local database instance — `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
2. Open the `server.js` file to view the implementation.
